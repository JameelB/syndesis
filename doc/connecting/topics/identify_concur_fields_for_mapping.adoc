= Map integration data fields to SAP Concur fields

In most integrations, you need to add a data mapping step before a 
connection to SAP Concur. In the data mapping step, you map data fields
that are available from previous integration steps to SAP Concur action
parameters. In the data mapper, the *Target* panel displays the
SAP Concur parameters for the action that you selected when you added
the SAP Concur connection to the integration.

In this release, you might want to invoke the following 
https://developer.concur.com/api-explorer/v3-0/Lists.html[SAP Concur actions]. 

* Get all lists requires the `limit` parameter. The `offset` parameter is optional.
* Get a single list requires the `id` parameter.
* Create a new list requires the `content` parameter.
* Update a list requires the `id` and `content` parameters.

Suppose that an integration starts by executing a SQL stored procedure
that obtains new project codes. The integration finishes by adding
new project codes to SAP Concur. 
The following procedure provides an example of a data mapper step before
the SAP Concur connection. 

. In {prodname}, in the left panel, hover over the plus sign that is
between the database connection and the SAP Concur connection to display a pop-up in which
you click *Add a Step*.
. Click *Data Mapper*. When the data fields
appear, the *Sources* panel on the left displays the fields that are
available from the database connection. In this example, the
source fields include `concur-list-id` and `project-code`.
The *Target* panel on the right displays the SAP Concur `id` and
`content` parameters for the update list action, which the connection
performs. 
. Map the `concur-list-id` source field to the `id` target field.
. Map the `project-code` source field to the `content` target field. 
. In the upper right, click *Done* to add the data mapper step to the integration.
